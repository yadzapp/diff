/* Moving between source files without reloading the page.

   A file page and the one next to it differ in one thing: the listing. The
   header, the build picker, the search palette and — the expensive one — the
   2,825-row tree in the left column are the same on both, and a full
   navigation throws all of it away and builds it again: refetch files.json,
   re-render the tree, lose the reader's place in it, rebuild the minimap,
   re-highlight the code. That work is why switching files feels like
   something happening rather than something arriving, even though the HTML
   itself is quick.

   So the document stays and only the parts that differ are replaced: what is
   inside <main>, what is inside the page bar, the title, and the two data
   attributes that say which page this is. Then the handful of features that
   describe a listing rather than the site are run again over the new markup.
   The tree, and the reader's scroll position in it, are never touched.

   What this is not: a router. Only same-build source pages are taken, and
   only from a plain left click. Anything else — another build, a class page,
   a new tab, no History API, a fetch that fails — is left to the browser,
   which is also the fallback when any of this goes wrong. Every URL is a real
   page that stands on its own; this only saves the trip.

   Deep links, back and forward keep working because the URL is pushed before
   the page is painted: everything downstream reads location, and links.json
   is fetched relative to it. */
