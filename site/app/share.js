/* Sharing a line, or a run of them.

   A mod is talked about one function at a time, and the unit of that
   conversation is a link: "look at this". Every line of a source page already
   carries an id and every cross-reference the generator writes already points
   at one, so the only thing missing was a way to make such a link without
   knowing that #L42 was a thing you could type.

   Clicking is that way: click a line to take it, shift-click a second to take
   everything between, click the one you hold to let go. The URL follows
   along, which makes the address bar itself the link; the strip at the foot
   of the window hands it over without the trip up there, along with the code
   as text and the same lines on GitHub. */
