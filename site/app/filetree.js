/* The files tree, beside the file.

   The whole tree stands next to one file's source, so reading a folder means
   clicking down it rather than going back to the index and finding your place
   again. It comes up as the reader left it (site/app/tree.js), with the
   folders down to the open file expanded on top of that: 2,825 files is not a
   list anyone scrolls, and the file being read is the one row that has to be
   in it.

   At /files/ the column arrives in the markup, where the tree is the page's
   own content; there this only wires it. Beside a source file it is built
   here instead, for the reason the minimap is: a file page's bytes have to
   stay identical across every build that did not touch that file, which is
   what lets ~660,000 pages be hard links to a few thousand, and a tree
   inlined into them would be rewritten by every build and undo that on every
   page at once. The paths come from files.json (see src/generate/routes.js),
   which is the tree and nothing else — a fifth of a percent of the search
   index the source view fetches for its links, so the column fills in rather
   than arriving.

   The empty column goes in before the tree does, so the source is laid out
   once, in its final place, rather than being shunted right when the paths
   land.

   The arrows walk it as soon as the tree is there, starting from the open
   file, with nothing to focus or click first; Home and End are left to the
   source. A column beside a source page is for wide viewports only, on the
   same terms as the table of contents: below that the page is the text. */
