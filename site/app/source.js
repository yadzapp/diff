/**
 * Where a name written in source goes. Doxygen linked every name in its
 * source pages to the declaration it resolved to, which is most of what made
 * them worth reading when 89% of members carry no documentation. It resolved
 * by scope, and so does this: the file's links.json says which class body
 * each line falls inside and what that class inherits from, and search.json
 * says which classes declare a name, so a bare call inside a method is
 * looked up against its own class and then up the chain.
 *
 * A name that no enclosing class answers to falls back to the build-wide
 * index, where it is linked only if exactly one declaration claims it.
 * Anything still ambiguous is left as plain text, which is what Doxygen did
 * with a name it could not resolve either.
 *
 * A quoted string that is exactly a class or enum name, or that names a
 * script file this build has (uniquely, by path or basename), is linked
 * the same way. Game-data paths are left alone: those files are not here.
