# DIFF — DayZ Internal File Finder by YADZ

A DayZ scripts documentation website. Browsable documentation for the
DayZ Enforce Script sources — every class, method, enum and constant —
generated from the official
[DayZ Script Diff](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/DayZ-Script-Diff)
repository.

**Site:** [diff.yadz.app](https://diff.yadz.app)

- 🔍 **Search** — find any class, method, enum, or constant
- 🌳 **Inheritance trees** — see the full type hierarchy and inherited members
- 📄 **Syntax-highlighted sources** — browse the script files as they ship
- 📋 **Changelog** — API diff between any two PC stable builds
- 🔗 **Usage** — where each member is called, when the sources have no official docs
- 📝 **Community notes** — short annotations on types and members
- 📦 **Build archive** — older PC stables stay at `/v/<label>/` (e.g. `/v/129u3/`)
- 🤖 **LLM-ready** — `api.json`, `llms.txt`, `agent.md`, and Copy for LLM on class and enum pages
- 📡 **Feed** — new builds as they ship, as Atom

## What's on the site

- [Classes](https://diff.yadz.app/classes/) — annotated list, [A–Z index](https://diff.yadz.app/classes/index/), [inheritance tree](https://diff.yadz.app/classes/hierarchy/), and every inherited member on `/classes/<Name>/members/`
- [Topics](https://diff.yadz.app/topics/) — the `\defgroup` groups the sources wrap themselves into (math, physics, entities, widgets, …)
- [Files](https://diff.yadz.app/files/) — the script tree, plus [globals](https://diff.yadz.app/globals/) declared outside a class
- [Changelog](https://diff.yadz.app/changelog/) — API diff between any two builds
- [Feed](https://diff.yadz.app/feed.xml) — new builds as they ship, as Atom; every class and enum page also unfolds its own build-by-build history

Older builds stay at `/v/<label>/…` (e.g. `/v/129u3/`; full build numbers still redirect). The PC stable changelog, official links and
community links are on the [homepage](https://diff.yadz.app/); the links
themselves are hand-maintained in `src/generate/content.js`. Bugs and
suggestions for this site: [Discord](https://discord.yadz.app/).

## For language models

The HTML pages are for people. Agents should start at
[`/llms.txt`](https://diff.yadz.app/llms.txt) and fetch the JSON rather than
scraping class pages. How to look a type up is in
[`/agent.md`](https://diff.yadz.app/agent.md).

- [`/agent.md`](https://diff.yadz.app/agent.md) — fetch the dump, overlay notes, do not scrape pages
- [`/api.json`](https://diff.yadz.app/api.json) — latest build: every class, method, field, enum, global, typedef and macro, with signatures, inheritance, file locations and doc briefs
- [`/search.json`](https://diff.yadz.app/search.json) — compact name index the site search uses
- [`/assets/notes.json`](https://diff.yadz.app/assets/notes.json) — community notes, keyed by `Type` or `Type.Member`
- [`/assets/versions.json`](https://diff.yadz.app/assets/versions.json) — every documented PC build

`api.json` is latest-only. The script sources it describes are under the DPL;
community notes are not.

For pasting into a chat by hand, every class and enum page has a
**Copy for LLM** button under its title: the page as Markdown — signatures,
inheritance, docs and community notes — with its build and source named.

## Community notes

A community note is a short annotation on a class, enum, or member. Add it to
`site/notes.json`, keyed by type name or `Type.Member`:

```json
{
  "PlayerBase": "Server-side only outside of simulation callbacks.",
  "PlayerBase.SetQuantity": "Clamps to the config maximum instead of failing; read it back with `GetQuantity()`."
}
```

Edit that file and open a pull request. `Type.Member` covers every overload of
that name; enum values key off the value name; backticks render as code. Notes
show up on class and enum pages, labelled as community writing, on every build
at once.

`test/api.test.js` rejects a key that is not `Type` or `Type.Member`, an empty
value, or an unclosed backtick.

## Local development

Requires Node.js 20+ and git. No npm dependencies.

```sh
npm run fetch            # clone/update upstream, detect versions
npm run parse            # parse all versions into JSON models (cached by commit)
npm run dev              # http://localhost:3000 — render on demand, reload on save
npm run generate         # write the static site into dist/
npm run generate:latest  # newest build only
npm run generate:verify  # re-render reused pages and fail if one changed
npm run build            # fetch, parse and generate
npm run preview          # serve a real dist/ at http://localhost:3000
npm test
```

`npm run dev` is the inner loop. It needs `fetch` and `parse`, not `generate`.
It loads the newest build once and renders whichever page you open; older
builds work the same at `/v/<label>/`. Assets come straight from `site/`.

Use `npm run preview` to check archive rewrites, redirects and the sitemap.
After changing the parser, re-run with `FORCE_PARSE=1 npm run parse` (or
`ONLY_VERSION=1.29` for one build) so the commit-sha cache is not reused.
`LINK_THREADS` overrides how many threads do the filesystem writes.

The pipeline is `src/fetch.js` → `src/parse-all.js` → `src/generate/` (or
`src/dev.js` in development). `src/generate/routes.js` is the site map both
the writer and the dev server read. Page reuse, source links and the
Enforce Script parser are documented in the files that implement them.

When a new PC stable ships, add its forum thread (if it has one) in
`src/generate/content.js`. Builds without a thread still appear.

## Contributing

The usual path is a pull request. Notes go in `site/notes.json` (see
[Community notes](#community-notes)); everything else lives in this repo.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) maps which file renders which URL, where
the client-side behaviour lives, and the invariants to keep. Bugs and
suggestions: [Discord](https://discord.yadz.app/).
